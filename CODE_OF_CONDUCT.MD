# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community’s expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1.  Harassment. Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.

2.  Character attacks. Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.

3.  Stereotyping or discrimination. Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.

4.  Sexualization. Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.

5.  Violating confidentiality. Sharing or acting on someone’s personal or private information without their permission.

6.  Endangerment. Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.

7.  Behaving in other ways that threaten the well-being of our community.

## Other Restrictions

1.  Misleading identity. Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.

2.  Failing to credit sources. Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.

3.  Promotional materials. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.

4.  Irresponsible communication. Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, please contact [GitHub.Admin@swift.com](mailto:GitHub.Admin@swift.com).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated in a prompt and fair manner. The company may review and, when necessary, remove, revise, or decline comments, code, or other contributions that conflict with this Code of Conduct. During any investigation, the company will respect privacy, security, and confidentiality.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
